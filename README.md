# Midwifery Services Application
## About:
This is an mock-up application with an associated DB2 database that enables practitioners access to multiple midewifery services. The practitioner is able to login using his/her practitioner id, then he is able to use many services like checking appointments on a certain date, reviewing patient information, write new notes to a session, request a test for a patient, write prescriptions, and review old information. The DB2 database is connected to the application using the java.sql library.
