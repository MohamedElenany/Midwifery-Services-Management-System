# Midwifery Services Application
## About:
The main objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive mock-up database (DB2) and application for managing Midwifery services in Quebec, offering affordable and personalized healthcare for expecting parents. The system facilitates the registration of parents for the program, recording personal information and details of online information sessions. It enables institutions to assign couples to specific midwives, tracks appointments and associated notes throughout the pregnancy and postpartum period. Medical test samples and lab referrals are managed, along with diverse due date estimates, blood types, baby information, and backup midwife assignments. The system also handles birth location decisions and maintains contact information for healthcare institutions. This project aims to streamline Midwifery service management, ensuring efficient healthcare delivery while simplifying administrative tasks for midwives and institutions.

## Business Value: 
The business value of the described project is multifaceted. Firstly, it streamlines and enhances the management of Midwifery services, optimizing the allocation of resources, and ensuring efficient healthcare delivery. This, in turn, can lead to cost savings for healthcare institutions. Secondly, it promotes affordable and personalized healthcare, which is a significant selling point for the expecting parents, enhancing their experience and potentially increasing participation in the program. Additionally, the system's ability to manage medical test samples, lab referrals, and test results enhances healthcare quality and monitoring. For healthcare institutions and midwives, it simplifies administrative tasks, reducing the administrative burden. Furthermore, the database can provide valuable data for research and analysis in the field of midwifery and maternal healthcare. Overall, this project not only improves healthcare service delivery but also presents potential cost savings and research opportunities, making it a valuable asset for healthcare providers and organizations.
