# Midwifery Services Management System

## Main Objective

The Midwifery Services Management System is designed to develop a comprehensive database (DB2) and application for efficiently managing Midwifery services in Quebec. The primary objective is to provide affordable and personalized healthcare for expecting parents by streamlining administrative tasks and enhancing healthcare service delivery.

## Creating the App

### Relational Schema

The relational schema for the Midwifery Services Management System encompasses various entities such as parents, midwives, institutions, appointments, medical tests, and more. The relationships between these entities are carefully modeled, taking into account the cardinality of relationships to represent the flow of information throughout the pregnancy and postpartum period.

### SQL Table Creation and Data Insertion

The SQL tables are created based on the relational schema, ensuring a structured and efficient storage system. Key attributes are underlined, and foreign keys are appropriately indicated to establish relationships between tables. Data insertion follows, populating the database with essential information such as parent details, appointment records, medical test results, and more.

### Java App Creation

The system's functionality is realized through a Java application, providing a user-friendly interface for managing Midwifery services. The app allows for seamless registration of parents, assignment of midwives, tracking of appointments and notes, and management of medical tests. It ensures a smooth user experience while interacting with the comprehensive healthcare management system.
